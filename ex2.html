    <p>The solar system is a gravitationally bound system consisting of the Sun, eight planets, various moons, dwarf
        planets, and countless asteroids, comets, and other small bodies.
        The Sun, a star, is at the center, and the planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
        Neptune) orbit around it. </p>

            <p>Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in our solar system. It is a rocky body
                like Earth and is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System. Mercury has an equatorial radius
                of 2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0 mi). It is less than half the size of Earth, which is about 7,926 miles
                (12,756 km) in diameter. Mercury is also the fastest planet in the solar system, completing each orbit
                around the sun in just 88 Earth days. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)">learn

            <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is known as Earth's "twin" or "sister" planet due to its
                similar size and structure. However, Venus has a thick, dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide and sulfuric
                acid clouds, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with surface temperatures hot enough to
                melt lead.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus">learn more</a> </p>

            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known astronomical object to harbor life. It is the
                fifth largest planet in our solar system, a rocky terrestrial planet with one moon. Earth is unique for
                its ocean planet status, with most of its water held in a global ocean covering 70.8% of its crust. </p>
